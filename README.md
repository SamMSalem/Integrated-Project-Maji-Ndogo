# SOLVING THE WATER CRISIS IN MAJI NDOGO

In this project, data analysis was carried out through MySQL Workbench to get insights into how to solve the water crisis in a country called 'Maji Ndogo'.

This project was one of the mandatory requirements for success in the Data Analysis scholarship course at the African Leadership Academy (ALX).

The Project was divided into four parts, each with a specific objective and goal. The first part was carried out through Excel, so the data and code are not included in this repository.
